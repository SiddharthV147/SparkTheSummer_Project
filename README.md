# Deepfake AI Detection for Social Media

## Overview

This repository contains the User Interface (UI) and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model developed to identify and block AI-generated deepfake images on social media platforms. The primary goal is to ensure that AI-generated images are detected and prevented from spreading on social media, thereby maintaining the integrity and authenticity of visual content.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the web pages.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python to handle backend operations and API integration.
- **Python**: Used for developing the AI model for deepfake detection.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch: For building and training the deepfake detection model.
  - OpenCV: For image processing.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
